/// blink tests for the occultation of a point in a semi-detached
/// binary. blink = true when point is eclipsed, otherwise = false. It works 
/// by first trying to eliminate as many paths that go nowhere near the 
/// Roche lobe before getting down to the hard work of stepping
/// along the path.
///
/// NB Note that this version of !!emph{blink} works in units of binary separation
/// NOT the inner lagrangian point distance.
///
/// \param q the mass ratio = M2/M1.
/// \param r the position vector (in units of binary separation)
/// \param e unit vector pointing towards Earth. Standardly this is (sini(i)*cos(phi),-sin(i)*sin(phi),cos(i))
/// \param acc step size parameter. acc specifies the size of steps taken when trying to see if the 
/// photon path goes inside the Roche lobe. The step size is roughly acc times the radius of the lobe filling star. 
/// This means that the photon path could mistakenly not be occulted if it passed less than about (acc**2)/8 of 
/// the radius below the surface of the Roche lobe. acc of order 0.1 should therefore do the job.
/// \return false = not eclipsed; true = eclipsed.
